      <p>
        TskrBase is a open source system to allow for users, groups, and roles
        to be managed in one system. The idea here is, Start with this
        repository and add the tables you need to track.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will be the base for the Tskr system. Tskr will add Tasks to this
        mix.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a low-cost system where you define complex rules to execute the
        business needs you have â€” that&apos;s Tskr. We are an opinionated
        system. We make the decisions so you don&apos;t have to.
      </p>
      <h2>What TskrBase is built on</h2>
